## Currently Learning
- Managing database systems with **Python** (numpy, pandas, matplotlib) and **SQL** 
- Data analysis and retrieval with **SAS**
- Advancing **Git** and **GitHub** proficiency  

## Outside of Work
Outside of work, I enjoy reading about the history of mathematics and statistics! I am currently reading *The Lady Tasting Tea* by David Salsburg. I also enjoy cycling outside (when weather permits), listening to Jazz music, and collecting wristwatches!
